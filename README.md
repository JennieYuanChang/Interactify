## Introduction
### Background and Development
To redesign the advertisement experience for ROKU users, our team was focusing on how to take advantage of ROKUâ€™s data collection. For our first wedge, we were designing a new real-time dynamic advertisement panel. The idea was to create a platform for advertisers to adjust their advertising content according to the reaction of ROKU users. However, it seemed like a rather expensive and infeasible system to build and it might require many back-end implements on the ROKU end.

We were still struggling with the idea of dynamic advertisement until the first sketch section, when we came up with two prototypical ideas: 1. Dual Screen Interaction, and 2. Point Of Sale. They were by far the more actionable ideas after our talking to our ROKU company advisors, Dan, Jake, Tommy. To implement dual screen interaction, we can take advantage of the ROKU remote on the mobile app, which has basic features such as remote control and a search function. For point of sale, ROKU is attempting and willing to try out a new advertising format. Advisors of ROKU were also interested in the voice-recognition system for point of sale, but our team opted for the dual screen because not only does it offer maximum flexibility, but it also lets us take advantage of point of sale, promos, downloads, and other mediums.

### Our Plan
In essence, our plan is to enhance advertisement experience for users leveraging the second screen. Our reasoning is that, since TV experience is becoming more of a combination between TV and Mobile end, it is better if we can make users interact with us on the ROKU app. This interaction not only creates more dimensionalities of data to run analysis on, but also create better user experience. Advertisers can put their existing advertisement into new formats, like sprite display (as well as existing tv formats), something we looked at and experimented with by looking at the top advertisements of 2016. 

In conclusion, we have come up with the idea to enhance advertisement interaction by using second screen as the medium. We also experimented with the specific formats of different categories of ads.
